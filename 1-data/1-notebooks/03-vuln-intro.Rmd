### Introduction {-}

Census tracts were assigned a “vulnerability score” between 0 and 4, with a weight of 1 for each
of the following that is true:

  * Greater than XX% of households are renters
  * Greater than XX% of the population are communities of color
  * Greater than XX% of the population 25 years and older do not have a bachelor’s degree
  * Greater than XX% of households have incomes at or below at or below 80% of the HUDadjusted
median family income (MFI) [Note: HUD's FY2015 MFI for the
Seattle-Bellevue, WA HUD Metro FMR Area was $89,500.]

We defined vulnerable tracts as those with a vulnerability score of at least 3 out of 4.
