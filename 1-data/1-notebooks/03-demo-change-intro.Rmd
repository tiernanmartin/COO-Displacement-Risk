We defined census tracts with gentrification-related demographic change from 2005-2009 to 2010-2014 as
those that experienced either at least 3 of the following 4:

  * The white population share either increased or it decreased less than X.0%
  * The share of homeowners either increased or it decreased less than X%
  * The share of the population 25 years and older with a bachelor’s degree increased more
than X%
  * The share of household earning more than 80% AMI increased or it decreased less than X%
or experienced only 2 out of 4, which were:
  * The white population share either increased or it decreased less than X%
