Some of the neighboring tracts are part of other county subdivision, but rather than targeting just those specific tracts, this method collects data for all King County tracts and then runs the analysis on the appropriate subsets. In the absence of a straight-forward method for identifying all the census tracts in the Seattle CCD subdivision of King County, it is possible to extract this information from American Factfinder. This tutorial describes how to use the American Factfinder interface to extract a list of all “all tracts within (or partially within) a census place”; substituting “county subdivision” for “place” will retrieve the desired results. A.1.4 Puget Sound Waterbodies These are useful for “clipping” census geographies whose boundaries extend into waterbodies.

A.2.1.1 Commmunities and Census Tracts The primary geographic unit of this assessment is the census tract. As is the case with many communities, the census geographies do not coincide exactly with the formal geographic boundary of the study’s three sites, and should be considered as spatial approximations of these communities. Listed below are the geographic identifiers of the census tracts that approximate each site.

This method is efficient, reproducible, and allows users to download census tables for a group of dissimilar geographies. To learn more about this, see the acs documentation. The following census geographies will be useful to collect for this analysis: tracts, King County combined tracts, each COO community individually and all three combined together county subdivision, Seattle CCD county, King The geospatial and tabular data is stored in a simple feature object, which simplifies analysis by allowing all geography types to be transformed and queried at the same time. Here is a summary of the simple feature object, showing a few examples of each geography type: FALSE Source: local data frame [9 x 4] FALSE Groups: GEOGRAPHY [5] FALSE FALSE NAME NAME_FULL GEOGRAPHY FALSE &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; FALSE 1 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; tract FALSE 2 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; tract FALSE 3 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; tract FALSE 4 RV Rainier Valley community FALSE 5 STKW SeaTac/Tukwila community FALSE 6 WC White Center community FALSE 7 COO COO Communities (combined) communities (multiple) FALSE 8 SEACCD Seattle CCD county subdivision FALSE 9 KC King County county FALSE # ... with 1 more variables: geometry &lt;simple_feature&gt; A.2.2 Maps A.2.2.1 Seattle CCD Tracts A.2.2.2 COO Tract-Communities #htmlwidget-8cc0e3463b292aab6e13 {float:left;margin:1px} FIGURE A.4: Rainier Valley, White Center, and SeaTac/Tukwila #htmlwidget-b1d0bec97eb5a9c68b29 {float:left;margin:1px} FIGURE A.4: Rainier Valley, White Center, and SeaTac/Tukwila #htmlwidget-2185d795d8fd7ff7b675 {float:left;margin:1px} FIGURE A.4: Rainier Valley, White Center, and SeaTac/Tukwila "],

Brown University’s Longitudinal Tract Database provides “crosswalk” datasets that clarify which tract change from decade to decade and what type of change occurred (e.g., consolidation, split, many-to-many, none). Using the 2000-2010 crosswalk, a customized set of ACS geographies is prepared to ensure that the data between observation periods are comparable. This dataset is included in this repository, but may also be downloaded here. # Save an acs object c( acs::geo.make(state = &quot;WA&quot;,county = &quot;King&quot;), acs::geo.make(state = &quot;WA&quot;, county = &quot;King&quot;,county.subdivision = &quot;Seattle CCD&quot;), acs::geo.make(state = &quot;WA&quot;,county = &quot;King&quot;, tract = &#39;*&#39;) ) %&gt;% write_rds(root_file(&#39;1-data/4-interim/coo-geo-2009-acs.rds&#39;)) -->"]
