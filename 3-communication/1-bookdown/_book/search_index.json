Some of the neighboring tracts are part of other county subdivision, but rather than targeting just those specific tracts, this method collects data for all King County tracts and then runs the analysis on the appropriate subsets. In the absence of a straight-forward method for identifying all the census tracts in the Seattle CCD subdivision of King County, it is possible to extract this information from American Factfinder. This tutorial describes how to use the American Factfinder interface to extract a list of all “all tracts within (or partially within) a census place”; substituting “county subdivision” for “place” will retrieve the desired results. A.1.4 Puget Sound Waterbodies These are useful for “clipping” census geographies whose boundaries extend into waterbodies.
