Some of the neighboring tracts are part of other county subdivision, but rather than targeting just those specific tracts, this method collects data for all King County tracts and then runs the analysis on the appropriate subsets. In the absence of a straight-forward method for identifying all the census tracts in the Seattle CCD subdivision of King County, it is possible to extract this information from American Factfinder. This tutorial describes how to use the American Factfinder interface to extract a list of all “all tracts within (or partially within) a census place”; substituting “county subdivision” for “place” will retrieve the desired results. Tract boundaries sometimes change over time, particularly on years when the decennial census is conducted. While this project will primarily use the current set of boundaries, it is necessary to collect the tract boundaries of the 2000-2009 time period so that these datasets can be visually represented in choropleth diagrams. #htmlwidget-50d3bfcfc393693abded {float:left;margin:1px} #htmlwidget-b5289d61ea9b49155e5d {float:none;margin:1px} King County Waterbodies These are useful for “clipping” census geographies whose boundaries extend into waterbodies.

["A-2-census-data.html", "A.2 Census Data", " A.2 Census Data The US Census provides invaluable information about American communities. The datasets provided by the Census encompas many disparate topics, comprehensively cover the entire US population, and are freely available to download. However, there are some barriers to using these data sets. When dealing with small geographies like a neighborhood, the statistical uncertainty may be high because the information comes from a small sample of the population. This complicates common data processing steps like combining or calculating the proportion of given indicator. Additionally, because census tract boundaries are subject to change every ten years, datasets must be normalized to account for this change before any comparative analysis can begin. Lastly, the census datasets represent information that is specific to a given geography (e.g. people in Tukwila, or households in King County) and are, therefore, spatial in nature. Spatial data, from the Census or other sources, present their own challenges that researchers must address in their choice of methods. This analysis addresses these challenges by leveraging the capabilities of R, an opensource statistical programming language. While other software exists for working with Census data, there are several R-based tools that can be combined together efficiently and effectively. The method for downloading, organizing, and processing the data are summarized in the following steps: Define census geographies of interest Identify relevant tables from American Community Survey Download tables using the acs R package Normalize the pre-2010 dataset using Brown University’s Longitudinal Tract Database Approximate the COO site communities by combining census tracts ACS Geographies There are many ways to collect US Census data, but this method uses the R package called acs to extract data with the official US Census API. This method is efficient, reproducible, and allows users to download census tables for a group of dissimilar geographies. To learn more about this, see the acs package documentation. This analysis uses the following three types of census geographies: Counties (King) County subdivisions (Seattle CCD) Census tracts (all tracts within King County) ACS Tables The following tables from the American Community Survey (ACS) are used to created indicators in this assessment Table Name Topic Universe B03002 HISPANIC OR LATINO ORIGIN BY RACE Total population B15002 SEX BY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT FOR THE POPULATION 25 YEARS AND OVER Population 25 years and over B19001 HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2015 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) Households B25033 TOTAL POPULATION IN OCCUPIED HOUSING UNITS BY TENURE BY UNITS IN STRUCTURE Total population in occupied housing units Prior to normalization, the tables are stored in two separate dataframes: one for the 2005-2009 data, and another for the 2011-2015 data: Census Tables, 2005-2009 FALSE Simple feature collection with 375 features and 92 fields FALSE geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON FALSE dimension: XY FALSE bbox: xmin: -122.5279 ymin: 47.08446 xmax: -121.0657 ymax: 47.78033 FALSE epsg (SRID): NA FALSE proj4string: NA FALSE First 10 features: Census Tables, 2011-2015 FALSE Simple feature collection with 400 features and 92 fields FALSE geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON FALSE dimension: XY FALSE bbox: xmin: -122.5279 ymin: 47.08446 xmax: -121.0657 ymax: 47.78033 FALSE epsg (SRID): NA FALSE proj4string: NA FALSE First 10 features: Data Structure: acs objects distributed in sf objects In this method, each row contains a different census geography and each column contains a single column of a single census table.

The dataframe structure keeps related acs objects and geometries together, yielding benefits when the time comes to operate on the data. For example, if census tracts need to be normalized before temporal comparison (as is the case in this project), that process can occur in a single, comprehensive step rather than individually for each census table. This efficiency gain is particularly important if census tables are added or removed, which may occur fequently in the exploratory phase of an analysis. Normalized pre-2010 Data Ultimately the ACS data will be combined into a single simple feature object, but before that can happen the pre-2010 must be normalized. The LTDB 2000-2010 Crosswalk file is a tabular tool that clarifies which tracts change from decade to decade, what type of change occurred (e.g., consolidation, split, many-to-many, none), and what weighting metric should be used to inpute the pre-2010 values. This information makes it possible to conduct meaningful temporal analysis on tracts whose boundaries changed between the two decades. More information regarding the normalization method can be found at the Longitudinal Tract Database website. Once the pre-2010 data has been normalized, the data for the two observations periods can be combined into a single dataframe: FALSE Simple feature collection with 399 features and 176 fields FALSE geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON FALSE dimension: XY FALSE bbox: xmin: -122.5279 ymin: 47.08446 xmax: -121.0657 ymax: 47.78033 FALSE epsg (SRID): NA FALSE proj4string: NA FALSE First 10 features: COO Communities The primary geographic unit of this assessment is the census tract. As is the case with many communities, the census geographies do not coincide exactly with the formal geographic boundary of the study’s three sites, and should be considered as spatial approximations of these communities.

["A-3-king-county-assessor-data.html", "A.3 King County Assessor Data", " A.3 King County Assessor Data Tax parcels are the pieces of land associated with property value. King County appraises parcels in order to determine an estimate of their fair market value, which is then used in the process of determening taxation rates. For the purpose of this assessment, parcels are the geographic unit of the indicator of housing market conditions: median residential property value. More information about the parcel dataset is available at the King County GIS Center: KCGIS Center Parcel Shapefile Metadata The Dataset The King County parcel dataset is a large spatiotemporal dataset comprised of approximately 600,000 annually-updated records. There are several factors worth mentioning about how these data were obtained, what they represent, and how the will be used in this analysis: Sources The parcel data is sepatated into a spatial dataset (polygons with minimal metadata) and several sets of tabular metadata that can be joined to each other or the spatial data using the unique Parcel Identification Number (PIN). The most current version of these data is made publicly available by King County GIS and the KC Assessor’s office (see the links provided above). This project requires historical property values which are only available by special request to the KC Assessor’s office. The complete parcel datasets were obtained for the 2005, 2010, and 2016 tax years, which correspond to the property values in 2004, 2009, and 2015 (respectively). Like the most current dataset, these data are split into one geospatial and several accompanying tabular metadata sets for each year. Temporal Change In order to assess property value patterns it is important to be aware of the fact that parcels come and go. More specifically, the county’s stock of parcels changes over time as property owners either subdivide or merge their properties. These changes create new PIN codes and eliminate old ones, resulting in historically discontinuous records for these parcels. Fortuntately, the geographic unit of analysis for this project is the census tract rather than the individual parcels themselves. In order to calculate the median residential property value for each tract, it is only necessary to determine which tract each parcel is within for each observations period; it is not necessary to know the changes of each individual parcel’s property value over time. Method The large size of these datasets present challenges, particularly for computationally expensive GIS operations. The following process makes an effort to reduce the volume of data involved in the geospatial overlay operations while producing the desired summary statistic: median residential property value by tract by year. Process 2014 Observations Reduce geospatial data from polygons to points (rgeos::gCentroid()) Subset data to include only those parcel within the Seattle CCD of King County Pass census tract unique identifier codes (GEOID) to parcel points using a spatial overlay (sp::over()) 2004 &amp; 2009 Observations Subset the geospatial data to include only those parcels that are not present in the 2015 data Repeat the same same spatial overlay process used in the 2014 observations to transfer GEOIDs to parcels Combined Data Add a new variable to record the year of the observation to each dataset (YEAR) Merge the datasets (by PIN), using an operation that retains all records (dplyr::full_join()) Calendar Year 2015 / Tax Year 2016 FALSE Simple feature collection with 612313 features and 5 fields FALSE geometry type: POINT FALSE dimension: XY FALSE bbox: xmin: -122.5314 ymin: 47.08658 xmax: -121.0889 ymax: 47.77919 FALSE epsg (SRID): 4326 FALSE proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs FALSE First 10 features: Calendar Year 2004 / Tax Year 2005 FALSE Simple feature collection with 590074 features and 9 fields FALSE geometry type: POINT FALSE dimension: XY FALSE bbox: xmin: -122.5315 ymin: 47.08616 xmax: -121.0883 ymax: 47.77937 FALSE epsg (SRID): 4326 FALSE proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs FALSE First 10 features: Calendar Year 1999 / Tax Year 2000 FALSE Simple feature collection with 564733 features and 9 fields FALSE geometry type: POINT FALSE dimension: XY FALSE bbox: xmin: -122.5315 ymin: 47.08616 xmax: -121.0883 ymax: 47.77937 FALSE epsg (SRID): 4326 FALSE proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs FALSE First 10 features: X "],

["A-6-housing-market-indicators.html", "A.6 Housing Market Indicators", " A.6 Housing Market Indicators Housing market patterns provide an important compliment to the two demographic indicator groups, but they come with their own set of challenges. While all of the data underlying the vulnerability and demographic change indicators comes from the American Community Survey, the housing market data used in this method is provided by the King County tax assessor. The first and most obvious challenge is the size and accessibility of this data; King County has approximate 600,000 parcels and their spatial and metadata is stored across a set of large tabular files that must be manually joined. Additionally, there is no official documentation linking a given parcel to a census tract, so this relationship must be established with using geospatial methods that are computationally expensive (i.e., time consuming). Finally, determining the unit of measure for this indicator is more complicated than it might at first appear: ultimately there must be a median housing value for each tract, but determining which properties to include in the sample requires consideration. The method used by Lisa Bates uses ACS Table B25077 (Median Value of Owner-Occupied Housing Units), but that sample is not directly reproducible given the available metadata from the King County dataset. The tax assessor data is structured around parcels as the primary unit (with some exception given to condominium units), and there is no simple method for transforming those units into housing units. This method considers the following approximations samples as reasonable approximations of value per housing unit: residential types that are typically owner-occupied (not vacant, excludes condominiums) Present Use Codes The following categories of “Present Use” (a classification used by the King County assessor) are used to filter the parcel data: CODE DESCRIPTION ASSUMED UNIT COUNT 2 Single Family(Res Use/Zone) 1 3 Duplex 2 4 Triplex 3 5 4-Plex 4 6 Single Family(C/I Zone) 1 7 Houseboat 1 8 Mobile Home 1 9 Single Family(C/I Use) 1 "],
