Some of the neighboring tracts are part of other county subdivision, but rather than targeting just those specific tracts, this method collects data for all King County tracts and then runs the analysis on the appropriate subsets. In the absence of a straight-forward method for identifying all the census tracts in the Seattle CCD subdivision of King County, it is possible to extract this information from American Factfinder. This tutorial describes how to use the American Factfinder interface to extract a list of all “all tracts within (or partially within) a census place”; substituting “county subdivision” for “place” will retrieve the desired results. Tract boundaries sometimes change over time, particularly on years when the decennial census is conducted. While this project will primarily use the current set of boundaries, it is necessary to collect the tract boundaries of the 2000-2009 time period so that these datasets can be visually represented in choropleth diagrams. #htmlwidget-689910e1c906fa937d68 {float:left;margin:1px} #htmlwidget-5af88acb20f413549e08 {float:none;margin:1px} King County Waterbodies These are useful for “clipping” census geographies whose boundaries extend into waterbodies.

["census-data.html", "A.2 Census Data", " A.2 Census Data The US Census provides invaluable information about American communities. The datasets provided by the Census encompas many disparate topics, comprehensively cover the entire US population, and are freely available to download. However, there are some barriers to using these data sets. When dealing with small geographies like a neighborhood, the statistical uncertainty may be high because the information comes from a small sample of the population. This complicates common data processing steps like combining or calculating the proportion of given indicator. Additionally, because census tract boundaries are subject to change every ten years, datasets must be normalized to account for this change before any comparative analysis can begin. Lastly, the census datasets represent information that is specific to a given geography (e.g. people in Tukwila, or households in King County) and are, therefore, spatial in nature. Spatial data, from the Census or other sources, present their own challenges that researchers must address in their choice of methods. This analysis addresses these challenges by leveraging the capabilities of R, an opensource statistical programming language. While other software exists for working with Census data, there are several R-based tools that can be combined together efficiently and effectively. The method for downloading, organizing, and processing the data are summarized in the following steps: Define census geographies of interest Identify relevant tables from American Community Survey Download tables using the acs R package Normalize the pre-2010 dataset using Brown University’s Longitudinal Tract Database Approximate the COO site communities by combining census tracts ACS Geographies There are many ways to collect US Census data, but this method uses the R package called acs to extract data with the official US Census API. This method is efficient, reproducible, and allows users to download census tables for a group of dissimilar geographies. To learn more about this, see the acs package documentation. This analysis uses the following three types of census geographies: Counties (King) County subdivisions (Seattle CCD) Census tracts (all tracts within King County) ACS Tables The following tables from the American Community Survey (ACS) are used to created indicators in this assessment Table Name Topic Universe B03002 HISPANIC OR LATINO ORIGIN BY RACE Total population B15002 SEX BY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT FOR THE POPULATION 25 YEARS AND OVER Population 25 years and over B19001 HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2015 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) Households B25033 TOTAL POPULATION IN OCCUPIED HOUSING UNITS BY TENURE BY UNITS IN STRUCTURE Total population in occupied housing units Prior to normalization, the tables are stored in two separate dataframes: one for the 2005-2009 data, and another for the 2011-2015 data: Census Tables, 2005-2009 FALSE Simple feature collection with 375 features and 92 fields FALSE geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON FALSE dimension: XY FALSE bbox: xmin: -122.5279 ymin: 47.08446 xmax: -121.0657 ymax: 47.78033 FALSE epsg (SRID): NA FALSE proj4string: NA FALSE First 10 features: Census Tables, 2011-2015 FALSE Simple feature collection with 400 features and 92 fields FALSE geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON FALSE dimension: XY FALSE bbox: xmin: -122.5279 ymin: 47.08446 xmax: -121.0657 ymax: 47.78033 FALSE epsg (SRID): NA FALSE proj4string: NA FALSE First 10 features: Data Structure: acs objects distributed in sf objects In this method, each row contains a different census geography and each column contains a single column of a single census table.

The dataframe structure keeps related acs objects and geometries together, yielding benefits when the time comes to operate on the data. For example, if census tracts need to be normalized before temporal comparison (as is the case in this project), that process can occur in a single, comprehensive step rather than individually for each census table. This efficiency gain is particularly important if census tables are added or removed, which may occur fequently in the exploratory phase of an analysis. Normalized pre-2010 Data Ultimately the ACS data will be combined into a single simple feature object, but before that can happen the pre-2010 must be normalized. The LTDB 2000-2010 Crosswalk file is a tabular tool that clarifies which tracts change from decade to decade, what type of change occurred (e.g., consolidation, split, many-to-many, none), and what weighting metric should be used to inpute the pre-2010 values. This information makes it possible to conduct meaningful temporal analysis on tracts whose boundaries changed between the two decades. More information regarding the normalization method can be found at the Longitudinal Tract Database website. Once the pre-2010 data has been normalized, the data for the two observations periods can be combined into a single dataframe: FALSE Simple feature collection with 399 features and 176 fields FALSE geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON FALSE dimension: XY FALSE bbox: xmin: -122.5279 ymin: 47.08446 xmax: -121.0657 ymax: 47.78033 FALSE epsg (SRID): NA FALSE proj4string: NA FALSE First 10 features: COO Communities The primary geographic unit of this assessment is the census tract. As is the case with many communities, the census geographies do not coincide exactly with the formal geographic boundary of the study’s three sites, and should be considered as spatial approximations of these communities. Listed below are the geographic identifiers of the census tracts that approximate each site.

["indicators.html", "A.4 Indicators", " A.4 Indicators This method seeks to classify census tracts according to a typology of neighborhood change. This typology is determined using three indicators: vulnerability, demographic change, and the housing market.4 Vulnerability and demographic change are measured using US Census data, while the housing market is measured using King County Tax Assessor data. Vulnerability The concept of “vulnerability” has received considerable attention by social science researchers, policy experts, and the media; it has also been subject to some criticism.5 A tract is considered “vulnerable” if it exceeds the county subdivision value for any three of the four indicators: Greater than 40% of the population belong to communities of color Greater than 52% of households are renters Greater than 55% of the population 25 years and older do not have a bachelor’s degree Greater than 46% of households have incomes at or below 80% of the HUD-adjusted median family income (MFI)6 Race: People Belonging to Communities of Color [[Descriptive text here]] Seattle CCD These maps show the share of the population that belongs to a community of color for each census tract in Seattle CCD. #htmlwidget-7c3f505ab2e175e6c3a1 {text-transform:uppercase;text-shadow:-1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 1px #FFFFFF,1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 -1px #FFFFFF} COO Communities #htmlwidget-214842b7c0e9f2cb2875 {float: left;margin:3px;text-transform:uppercase;text-shadow:-1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 1px #FFFFFF,1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 -1px #FFFFFF} #htmlwidget-e9cbc8e4a51e974f1b33 {float: none;margin:3px;text-transform:uppercase;text-shadow:-1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 1px #FFFFFF,1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 -1px #FFFFFF} Education: Adults with Less than a Bachelor Degree [[Descriptive text here]] Seattle CCD These maps show the share of the adults who’s highest education attainment is less than a bachelor degree for each census tract in Seattle CCD. #htmlwidget-51f0538e48b4a34acf88 {text-transform:uppercase;text-shadow:-1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 1px #FFFFFF,1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 -1px #FFFFFF} COO Communities #htmlwidget-cfe9415b20799017dfdf {float: left;margin:3px;text-transform:uppercase;text-shadow:-1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 1px #FFFFFF,1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 -1px #FFFFFF} #htmlwidget-ebfb5e0bc628564c8d40 {float: none;margin:3px;text-transform:uppercase;text-shadow:-1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 1px #FFFFFF,1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 -1px #FFFFFF} Income: Household Earning 80% AMI or Less [[Descriptive text here]] Seattle CCD These maps show the share of households earning less than 80% AMI for each census tract in Seattle CCD. #htmlwidget-435f5b58a07e12d6b0e0 {text-transform:uppercase;text-shadow:-1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 1px #FFFFFF,1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 -1px #FFFFFF} COO Communities #htmlwidget-3a0fcfa1affa33020219 {float: left;margin:3px;text-transform:uppercase;text-shadow:-1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 1px #FFFFFF,1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 -1px #FFFFFF} #htmlwidget-8a87e8e08168b7ca330e {float: none;margin:3px;text-transform:uppercase;text-shadow:-1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 1px #FFFFFF,1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 -1px #FFFFFF} Housing Tenure: Renters [[Descriptive text here]] Seattle CCD These maps show the share of the population that lives in rented housing units for each census tract in Seattle CCD. #htmlwidget-cc3b0e0732b68fc01925 {text-transform:uppercase;text-shadow:-1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 1px #FFFFFF,1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 -1px #FFFFFF} COO Communities #htmlwidget-cb8ecdd5ef7b0717b8c3 {float: left;margin:3px;text-transform:uppercase;text-shadow:-1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 1px #FFFFFF,1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 -1px #FFFFFF} #htmlwidget-89f9fe5eb3240020102a {float: none;margin:3px;text-transform:uppercase;text-shadow:-1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 1px #FFFFFF,1px 0 #FFFFFF,0 -1px #FFFFFF} Demographic Change A tract is considered to have experienced gentrification-related “demographic change” during the observation period (2004-2015) if any two of the following four indicators exceed the values observed in the county subdivision: The white population share either increased or it decreased less than -4.7% The share of homeowners either increased more than 3.3% The share of the population 25 years and older with a bachelor’s degree increased more than 6.1% The share of household earning more than 80% AMI increased or it decreased less than -4.6% Race: Change in Share of Whites [[Descriptive text here]] Seattle CCD These maps show change in the share of white people between the two observation periods for each census tract in Seattle CCD.
