Seattle Boundary FIGURE A.1: Seattle’s geographic boundary King County Subdivision Boundary FIGURE A.2: Seattle Subdivision of King County’s geographic boundary Tracts in King County Although this assessment is primarily focused on three communities within the Seattle CCD subdivision of King County, one of the indicators (housing market conditions) uses neighboring tracts to determine displacement risk. Some of the neighboring tracts are part of other county subdivision, but rather than targeting just those specific tracts, this method collects data for all King County tracts and then runs the analysis on the appropriate subsets. In the absence of a straight-forward method for identifying all the census tracts in the Seattle CCD subdivision of King County, it is possible to extract this information from American Factfinder. This tutorial describes how to use the American Factfinder interface to extract a list of all “all tracts within (or partially within) a census place”; substituting “county subdivision” for “place” will retrieve the desired results. Puget Sound Waterbodies These are useful for “clipping” census geographies whose boundaries extend into waterbodies. FIGURE A.3: Puget Sound waterbodies KC Tracts Without (Western) Waterbodies "],

Commmunities and Census Tracts The primary geographic unit of this assessment is the census tract. As is the case with many communities, the census geographies do not coincide exactly with the formal geographic boundary of the study’s three sites, and should be considered as spatial approximations of these communities. Listed below are the geographic identifiers of the census tracts that approximate each site.

This method is efficient, reproducible, and allows users to download census tables for a group of dissimilar geographies. To learn more about this, see the acs documentation. The following census geographies will be useful to collect for this analysis: tracts, King County combined tracts, each COO community individually and all three combined together county subdivision, Seattle CCD county, King The geospatial and tabular data is stored in a simple feature object, which simplifies analysis by allowing all geography types to be transformed and queried at the same time.

There are many possible ways to determine whether a household fits this category, but one commonly-used metric is the area median income (AMI). Generally speaking, households earning less than 80% AMI are considered to be low-income households, as status which has implications for affordable housing eligibility. The Lisa Bates used a fairly precise dataset for this indicator: percent of households that have incomes at or below at or below 80% of the HUD-adjusted median family income (MFI). The data source is HUD’s Consolidated Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) as used. Unfortunately, the most recent CHAS data is based on the 2009-2013 ACS 5-year estimate. Rather than introduce an inconsistency in the observation periods of this assessment’s datasets, this method uses an approximation of the 80% AMI metric using the ACS Household Income (B19001), 2010-2014 5-year estimate. This data is structured as household counts within a range of annual household income (e.g. $15,000 to $19,999). The FY 2015 MFI Estimate for Seattle-Bellevue, WA HUD Metro FMR Area is $89,500. In inflation-adjusted 2014 dollars that is $87,732.78, and 80% of that equals $70,200; which puts it within the $60,000 to $74,999 range. Therefore, for this assessment any household with an annual income of $74,999 or less is considered to be low-income.
