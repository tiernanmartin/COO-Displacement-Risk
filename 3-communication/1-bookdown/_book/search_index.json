["index.html", "", " The Community of Opportunity (COO) program is a platform for coordinating and supporting efforts to address systemic inequities in communities within Washington’s King County. The COO Data Workgroup is collection of representatives from the COO partners whose task is to develop data-driven strategies to describe, measure, and address conditions that need to be improved in each of the participating communities. The COO Displacement team formed as a subgroup of the COO Data Workgroup. The subgroup’s first meeting convened on March 10, 2016 with the goal of developing an explicit method for assessing displacement in the COO communities. The following sections provide a summary of the team’s discussion and their proposal to the Data Workgroup on March 24, 2016. Members of the displacement team expressed a shared interest in developing an approach that built upon existing methods from the body of research and case studies. The 2015 literature review published by UCLA/UC Berkeley researchers Zuk et al. provided an extensive foundation from which to assemble a set of methods that suit the COO project’s specific situation and requirements. The team compared the merits of individual indicator methods with those of composite index methods, and decided on an approach that incorporates parts of both strategies. The proposed method would adopt the displacement susceptibility methodology developed by researcher Lisa Bates and employed in Portland, OR; the San Francisco Bay Area, CA; and elsewhere. This approach uses a composite index of widely-available data sources to assess displacement susceptibility of communities. The index score is measured at the Census tract scale and categorizes the populations using a typology of displacement phases, each of which might be addressed by different policy strategies. A key limitation of this approach (and many others like it) is that it doesn’t measure residential displacement itself, and therefore is more complicated to interpret and different in nature from other COO Headline Indicators which are more direct in nature. The displacement team proposed a combination of the Bates susceptibility index (referred to below as the “Baseline”) with a set of anecdotal (“Drill Down”) indicators. This combination is a strategic choice based on the following three dynamics of this project: 1. The challenge of finding relevant data that is frequently updated 2. The need to strike a balance between using consistent methods and addressing the specific situations of the three sites 3. The need to expand the definition of displacement beyond the topic of housing to consider cultural institutions (including but not limited to small businesses, community centers, and health clinics) The Baseline is composed of indicators that can be updated every five years and will provide a consistent system of assessing, comparing, and supporting the three sites. The Drill Down indicators can be flexibly adapted to best suit each of the sites and will provide anecdotal insight into displacement conditions which can be monitored on an annual basis. Finally, changes in the presence of community institutions will be tracked using a selection of business types from the comprehensive list included in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

Some of the neighboring tracts are part of other county subdivision, but rather than targeting just those specific tracts, this method collects data for all King County tracts and then runs the analysis on the appropriate subsets. In the absence of a straight-forward method for identifying all the census tracts in the Seattle CCD subdivision of King County, it is possible to extract this information from American Factfinder. This tutorial describes how to use the American Factfinder interface to extract a list of all “all tracts within (or partially within) a census place”; substituting “county subdivision” for “place” will retrieve the desired results. Tract boundaries sometimes change over time, particularly on years when the decennial census is conducted. While this project will primarily use the current set of boundaries, it is necessary to collect the tract boundaries of the 2000-2009 time period so that these datasets can be visually represented in choropleth diagrams. #htmlwidget-87901954e569d032f067 {float:left;margin:1px} #htmlwidget-c63e7714b1026ff165cb {float:none;margin:1px} King County Waterbodies These are useful for “clipping” census geographies whose boundaries extend into waterbodies.

["A-2-census-data.html", "A.2 Census Data", " A.2 Census Data The US Census provides invaluable information about American communities. The datasets provided by the Census encompas many disparate topics, comprehensively cover the entire US population, and are freely available to download. However, there are some barriers to using these data sets. When dealing with small geographies like a neighborhood, the statistical uncertainty may be high because the information comes from a small sample of the population. This complicates common data processing steps like combining or calculating the proportion of given indicator. Additionally, because census tract boundaries are subject to change every ten years, datasets must be normalized to account for this change before any comparative analysis can begin. Lastly, the census datasets represent information that is specific to a given geography (e.g. people in Tukwila, or households in King County) and are, therefore, spatial in nature. Spatial data, from the Census or other sources, present their own challenges that researchers must address in their choice of methods. This analysis addresses these challenges by leveraging the capabilities of R, an opensource statistical programming language. While other software exists for working with Census data, there are several R-based tools that can be combined together efficiently and effectively. The method for downloading, organizing, and processing the data are summarized in the following steps: Define census geographies of interest Identify relevant tables from American Community Survey Download tables using the acs R package Normalize the pre-2010 dataset using Brown University’s Longitudinal Tract Database Approximate the COO site communities by combining census tracts ACS Geographies There are many ways to collect US Census data, but this method uses the R package called acs to extract data with the official US Census API. This method is efficient, reproducible, and allows users to download census tables for a group of dissimilar geographies. To learn more about this, see the acs package documentation. This analysis uses the following three types of census geographies: Counties (King) County subdivisions (Seattle CCD) Census tracts (all tracts within King County) ACS Tables The following tables from the American Community Survey (ACS) are used to created indicators in this assessment Table Name Topic Universe B03002 HISPANIC OR LATINO ORIGIN BY RACE Total population B15002 SEX BY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT FOR THE POPULATION 25 YEARS AND OVER Population 25 years and over B19001 HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2015 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) Households B25033 TOTAL POPULATION IN OCCUPIED HOUSING UNITS BY TENURE BY UNITS IN STRUCTURE Total population in occupied housing units Prior to normalization, the tables are stored in two separate dataframes: one for the 2005-2009 data, and another for the 2011-2015 data: Census Tables, 2005-2009 FALSE Simple feature collection with 375 features and 92 fields FALSE geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON FALSE dimension: XY FALSE bbox: xmin: -122.5279 ymin: 47.08446 xmax: -121.0657 ymax: 47.78033 FALSE epsg (SRID): NA FALSE proj4string: NA FALSE First 10 features: Census Tables, 2011-2015 FALSE Simple feature collection with 400 features and 92 fields FALSE geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON FALSE dimension: XY FALSE bbox: xmin: -122.5279 ymin: 47.08446 xmax: -121.0657 ymax: 47.78033 FALSE epsg (SRID): NA FALSE proj4string: NA FALSE First 10 features: Data Structure: acs objects distributed in sf objects In this method, each row contains a different census geography and each column contains a single column of a single census table.

The dataframe structure keeps related acs objects and geometries together, yielding benefits when the time comes to operate on the data. For example, if census tracts need to be normalized before temporal comparison (as is the case in this project), that process can occur in a single, comprehensive step rather than individually for each census table. This efficiency gain is particularly important if census tables are added or removed, which may occur fequently in the exploratory phase of an analysis. Normalized pre-2010 Data Ultimately the ACS data will be combined into a single simple feature object, but before that can happen the pre-2010 must be normalized. The LTDB 2000-2010 Crosswalk file is a tabular tool that clarifies which tracts change from decade to decade, what type of change occurred (e.g., consolidation, split, many-to-many, none), and what weighting metric should be used to inpute the pre-2010 values. This information makes it possible to conduct meaningful temporal analysis on tracts whose boundaries changed between the two decades. More information regarding the normalization method can be found at the Longitudinal Tract Database website. Once the pre-2010 data has been normalized, the data for the two observations periods can be combined into a single dataframe: FALSE Simple feature collection with 399 features and 176 fields FALSE geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON FALSE dimension: XY FALSE bbox: xmin: -122.5279 ymin: 47.08446 xmax: -121.0657 ymax: 47.78033 FALSE epsg (SRID): NA FALSE proj4string: NA FALSE First 10 features: COO Communities The primary geographic unit of this assessment is the census tract.

["A-3-king-county-assessor-data.html", "A.3 King County Assessor Data", " A.3 King County Assessor Data Tax parcels are the pieces of land associated with property value. King County appraises parcels in order to determine an estimate of their fair market value, which is then used in the process of determening taxation rates. For the purpose of this assessment, parcels are the geographic unit of the indicator of housing market conditions: median residential property value. More information about the parcel dataset is available at the King County GIS Center: KCGIS Center Parcel Shapefile Metadata The Dataset The King County parcel dataset is a large spatiotemporal dataset comprised of approximately 600,000 annually-updated records. There are several factors worth mentioning about how these data were obtained, what they represent, and how the will be used in this analysis: Sources The parcel data is sepatated into a spatial dataset (polygons with minimal metadata) and several sets of tabular metadata that can be joined to each other or the spatial data using the unique Parcel Identification Number (PIN). The most current version of these data is made publicly available by King County GIS and the KC Assessor’s office (see the links provided above). This project requires historical property values which are only available by special request to the KC Assessor’s office. The complete parcel datasets were obtained for the 2005, 2010, and 2016 tax years, which correspond to the property values in 2004, 2009, and 2015 (respectively). Like the most current dataset, these data are split into one geospatial and several accompanying tabular metadata sets for each year. Temporal Change In order to assess property value patterns it is important to be aware of the fact that parcels come and go. More specifically, the county’s stock of parcels changes over time as property owners either subdivide or merge their properties. These changes create new PIN codes and eliminate old ones, resulting in historically discontinuous records for these parcels. Fortuntately, the geographic unit of analysis for this project is the census tract rather than the individual parcels themselves. In order to calculate the median residential property value for each tract, it is only necessary to determine which tract each parcel is within for each observations period; it is not necessary to know the changes of each individual parcel’s property value over time. Method The large size of these datasets present challenges, particularly for computationally expensive GIS operations. The following process makes an effort to reduce the volume of data involved in the geospatial overlay operations while producing the desired summary statistic: median residential property value by tract by year.

["A-6-housing-market-indicators.html", "A.6 Housing Market Indicators", " A.6 Housing Market Indicators Housing market patterns provide an important compliment to the two demographic indicator groups, but they come with their own set of challenges. While all of the data underlying the vulnerability and demographic change indicators comes from the American Community Survey, the housing market data used in this method is provided by the King County tax assessor. The first and most obvious challenge is the size and accessibility of this data; King County has approximate 600,000 parcels and their spatial and metadata is stored across a set of large tabular files that must be manually joined. Additionally, there is no official documentation linking a given parcel to a census tract, so this relationship must be established with using geospatial methods that are computationally expensive (i.e., time consuming). Finally, determining the unit of measure for this indicator is more complicated than it might at first appear: ultimately there must be a median housing value for each tract, but determining which properties to include in the sample requires consideration. The method used by Lisa Bates uses ACS Table B25077 (Median Value of Owner-Occupied Housing Units), but that sample is not directly reproducible given the available metadata from the King County dataset. The tax assessor data is structured around parcels as the primary unit (with some exception given to condominium units), and there is no simple method for transforming those units into housing units. This method considers the following approximations samples as reasonable approximations of value per housing unit: residential types that are typically owner-occupied (not vacant, excludes condominiums) Present Use Codes The following categories of “Present Use” (a classification used by the King County assessor) are used to filter the parcel data: CODE DESCRIPTION ASSUMED UNIT COUNT 2 Single Family(Res Use/Zone) 1 3 Duplex 2 4 Triplex 3 5 4-Plex 4 6 Single Family(C/I Zone) 1 7 Houseboat 1 8 Mobile Home 1 9 Single Family(C/I Use) 1 "],
